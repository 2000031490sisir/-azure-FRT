Project Title*:
Sisir Den School

Industry*:
Ed-Tech

Problem Statement/Opportunity*:
Design a basic web application describing the kind of educational facilities and environment you wish a school could provide to every student 
across the world.

Project Description*:
The core idea of our project is to design a basic web application that provides the detailed information about the facilities provided by our 
school. By this project, we aim to explain the educational facilities that many schools lack in their curriculum and how are the facilities 
being provided by our school in a better way. Through our project, we sorted out the basic problems faced by every school management in providing 
the facilities such as conducting interactive lab experiments and conducting healthy and funny games among children. We also clearly mentioned 
simple key points for solving them.
